C interpreter written in Lisp.

All functions can be run on [JSCL](https://jscl-project.github.io/), a Common Lisp implementation on JavaScript.

### Resources

[Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) is great for getting started, specially after chapter 3.

[Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/): An excellent starting material for building an interpreter.

[Little Lisp Interpreter](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter): An introduction to Lisp by Mary Rose Cook.
